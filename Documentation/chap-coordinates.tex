\chapter{Coordinate system}

All drawing is accomplished in a left-handed two-dimensional
coordinate system.  The $x$ coordinate grows to the right, and the $y$
coordinate downward.

A \emph{pixel} in a coordinate system is a quadratic area with both
width and height of exactly one unit, and with the corners located on
integer coordinates in the system.  For brevity, when we talk about
the coordinates of a pixel, we only use two integer values, which then
mean the coordinates of the upper-left corner of that pixel.

An essential part of drawing is the concept of a \emph{triangle},
which is defined by three coordinates in the coordinate system.  The
type of these coordinates is \texttt{double-float}.

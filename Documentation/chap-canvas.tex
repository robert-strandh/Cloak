\Defclass {canvas}

This class is the protocol class of all objects that can be targets of
drawing operations.

\Defmacro {with-canvas} {(canvas-var canvas-form) \body body}

This macro is used to group several operations into a single final
rendering operation.

The argument \textit{canvas-form} is a form that evaluated once.  It
must evaluate to a canvas.

The argument \textit{canvas-var} is a symbol.  It is not evaluated.
In the body of the macro, this variable is bound to the result of
evaluating \textit{canvas-form}.

The \textit{body} can contain arbitrary forms, but the visible effect
of drawing operations is suspended until the end of the macro call.
Client code will typically wrap the entire event-handling machinery
inside a call to this macro.

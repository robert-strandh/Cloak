The purpose of this work is to define a graphics layer that can be
used by \commonlisp{} toolkits for creating graphic user interfaces.
It can be thought of as an intermediate backend, sitting between the
GUI toolkit itself and some concrete backend such as X11, OpenGL,
Wayland, etc.

The basis of this work is the recognition that most of the graphics
operations of a graphics user interface are not performance critical.
We can therefore afford to simplify the graphics model for such
operations, while still allowing for client code to access
backend-specific rendering primitives for highly performance-critical
applications.

\chapter{Mask}

\Defprotoclass {mask}

A mask is a supplier of \emph{opacity} values.  For each pixel in the
plane, a mask object is capable of supplying an opacity value.
Different subclasses of this class have different representation.

\Defclass {matrix-mask}

A mask of this type contains explicit storage for each opacity value
inside a rectangular subset of the plane.  For pixels outside that
rectangular subset, this mask type supplies an opacity value of 0d0,
i.e., totally transparent.

\Defclass {computed-mask}

A mask of this type contains a function that, when applied to a
horizontal and a vertical position, returns an opacity value.

\Defclass {triangle-mask}

A mask of this type contains a set of triangles, defined by their
corner coordinates.

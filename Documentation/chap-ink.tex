\Defprotoclass {ink}

An ink is a supplier of \emph{color}.  For each pixel in the plane, an
ink object is capable of supplying a value each for the three
elementary colors \emph{red}, \emph{blue}, and \emph{green}.

Backends are allowed to treat ink instances as being immutable, so
that it can create caches based on identity (in the sense of
\texttt{eq}) of such instances.  Therefore, even though an ink object
might be technically mutable, once it has been used in some operation
defined here, it should no longer be modified.

\Defclass {solid-ink}

This class is a subclass of the class named \texttt{ink}.  It returns
the same color values for every pixel in the plane.

\Defclass {matrix-ink}

Ink of this type contains explicit storage for each pixel value inside
a rectangular subset of the plane.  For pixels outside that
rectangular subset, some constant color values are supplied.

\Defclass {computed-ink}
